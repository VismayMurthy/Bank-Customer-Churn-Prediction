# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) based on historical customer data.
The model will help banks take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers by identifying patterns in customer behavior that lead to churn.
